-- 1) Create the Orders table so that all onum values as well as all combinations of cnum and snum are different from one another, 
-- and so that NULL values are excluded from the date field. 
create table ORDERS
(
Onum int(4) unique key,
Amt float(7,2),
Odate date not null,
Cnum int(4) ,
Snum int(4) ,
primary key(Cnum,Snum)
);

-- 2) Create the Salespeople table so that the default commission is 10% with no NULLS permitted,snum is the primary key 
-- , and all names fall alphabetically between A and M, inclusive (assume all names will be uppercase). 

create table salespeople
(
snum int(4) primary key,
comm float(5,2) default 0.1 not null,
sname varchar(10)
check ((substr(sname,1,1)) between'A' and 'M' )
);

-- 3) Create the Orders table, making sure that the onum is greater than the cnum, 
-- and the cnum is greater that the snum. Allow no NULLS in any of these three fields. 
create table list
(
onum int(4) not null,
snum int(4) not null,
cnum int(4) not null,
check(onum>cnum),
check(cnum>snum)
);
insert into list (onum,cnum,snum)
values(4,3,2);
select * from list;
